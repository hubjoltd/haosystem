Perfect question — here’s a **clear end-to-end picture** of how **Role Management** and **Staff Management** should work **inside the Super Admin main panel**, without ambiguity.

I’ll break it down logically and visually (conceptually).

---

# Super Admin Panel

## Role Management & Staff Management – Clear Picture

---

## 1. Super Admin Scope (Big Picture)

The **Super Admin**:

* Manages **all companies**
* Does **not belong to any single company**
* Controls:

  * Company creation
  * Mandatory roles (CEO, CFO, Application Admin)
  * Role templates & permissions
  * Staff management across companies

---

## 2. Role Management (Super Admin)

### 2.1 Role List Page

Super Admin sees:

* Company Name
* Role Name
* Role Type:

  * System Role (CEO, CFO, Application Admin)
  * Custom Role
* Status (Active / Inactive)
* Actions:

  * View
  * Edit
  * Delete (restricted for system roles)

---

### 2.2 Add Role

**Flow:**

* Select **Company**
* Enter **Role Name**
* Select **Role Type** (System / Custom)

**Permissions Setup:**

* Show **all sidebar modules**
* For each module:

  * View
  * Add
  * Edit
  * Delete (checkboxes)

**Rules:**

* System roles:

  * Cannot be deleted
  * Permissions can be edited (optional based on policy)
* Custom roles:

  * Full CRUD allowed

---

### 2.3 Edit Role

Super Admin can:

* Modify permissions
* Activate / deactivate role

**Impact:**

* Changes apply immediately to **all staff** using that role

---

### 2.4 View Role

Read-only view:

* Role name
* Company
* Assigned permissions
* Number of staff using this role

---

### 2.5 Delete Role

* Allowed **only for custom roles**
* Block deletion if:

  * Role is assigned to staff
* Show proper warning & reassignment option

---

## 3. Staff Management (Super Admin)

---

### 3.1 Staff List Page

Super Admin sees:

* Company
* Staff Name
* Email / Username
* Assigned Role
* Status (Active / Inactive)
* Actions:

  * View
  * Edit
  * Delete

---

### 3.2 Add Staff

**Flow:**

1. Select **Company**
2. Enter staff details:

   * Name
   * Email / Username
   * Phone (optional)
3. Assign:

   * **Role**
   * (Auto-inherits role permissions)
4. Authentication setup:

   * Login credentials
   * Company-specific access

**Rules:**

* Staff can belong to **one company at a time**
* Mandatory roles (CEO, CFO, App Admin) must have at least one active user

---

### 3.3 Edit Staff

Super Admin can:

* Change role
* Activate / deactivate staff
* Reset credentials

**Restrictions:**

* Cannot deactivate the **last active user** of:

  * CEO
  * CFO
  * Application Admin

---

### 3.4 View Staff

Read-only view:

* Staff details
* Company
* Role
* Effective permissions (derived from role)

---

### 3.5 Delete Staff

* Soft delete recommended
* Prevent deletion if:

  * Staff is the only user in a mandatory role

---

## 4. Permission Enforcement (Important)

### Sidebar Behavior

* Staff users see **only modules with View permission**

### Action Control

* Add / Edit / Delete:

  * Enforced at UI level
  * Enforced at API level (must)

---

## 5. Company Isolation Rules

* Roles → Company specific
* Staff → Company specific
* Permissions → Company specific
* Super Admin → Global access

---

## 6. Simple Mental Model

```
Super Admin
   ├── Companies
   │     ├── Roles (CEO, CFO, App Admin, Custom)
   │     │        └── Permissions (Module CRUD)
   │     └── Staff
   │              └── Assigned Role → Permissions
```

---

## 7. What I Can Do Next (Optional)

If you want, I can:

* Draw a **screen-by-screen UI flow**
* Create a **permission matrix table**
* Suggest **DB schema**
* Write **API endpoints** for role & staff management

Tell me what you want next and I’ll take it from here 🚀
