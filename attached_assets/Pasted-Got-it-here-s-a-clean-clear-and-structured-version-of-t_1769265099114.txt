Got it — here’s a **clean, clear, and structured version** of that requirement, consistent with everything we’ve defined so far 👇

---

## Mandatory System Roles During Company Creation

### 1. Default Roles for Every Company

* For **every company created**, the following roles must be **mandatory and auto-created**:

  * **CEO**
  * **CFO**
  * **Application Admin**

---

### 2. Authentication Requirement

* These roles must be:

  * Created **during company creation itself**
  * Required for **authentication and system access**
* Company creation should **not be completed** unless these roles are successfully created.

---

### 3. User Assignment During Company Creation

* While creating a company, system must allow:

  * Assigning at least one user to each mandatory role:

    * CEO
    * CFO
    * Application Admin
* Each assigned user must have:

  * Valid login credentials
  * Company-specific authentication access

---

### 4. Default Permissions

* Each mandatory role should have predefined permissions:

  * **Application Admin**

    * Full access (View / Add / Edit / Delete) to all modules
  * **CEO**

    * View access to all modules
    * Additional permissions as per business rules
  * **CFO**

    * View and Edit access to finance-related modules
    * Limited access to non-financial modules

*(Permissions should remain editable if required.)*

---

### 5. Company-Level Isolation

* These roles:

  * Exist **independently per company**
  * Must not be shared across companies
* Authentication and authorization must always be:

  * Scoped to the selected company and its unique URL
    (e.g., `abc.com/hao`, `abc.com/isd`)

---

### 6. Failure Handling

* If creation of any mandatory role or user fails:

  * Company creation should be rolled back
  * Clear error message should be shown

---

If you want, I can next:

* Merge **all requirements** into one final **System Requirement Document**
* Provide a **DB schema** for company + roles + users
* Define **authentication flow diagrams**

Just tell me what you want next 👍
